# channels-dvrGanttView
A different way to look at your channels-dvr recording schedule


python3 required. Can be run on a different host than your channels-dvr machine.

Please don't run this on a public facing machine!, Use at your OWN RISK, etc, etc.

Only standard python3 distribution modules should be required for this to work.

I currently run this in a screen session, will at some point daemonize it.
